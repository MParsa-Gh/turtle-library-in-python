# turtle-library-in-python

These files were created in 2021 and 2022, and they might seem simple. I had started learning Python, and the first library I worked with was Turtle. It’s been about 3 to 4 years since then!

In this repository, there are several Python files that you can run using the following command:
                                                                                  
    git clone https://github.com/MParsa-Gh/turtle-library-in-python.git

To run these files, you only need to have Python; there’s no need to install any additional libraries, as the Turtle library is pre-installed with Python by default.
